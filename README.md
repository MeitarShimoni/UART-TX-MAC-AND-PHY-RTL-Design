# UART TX Controller — FPGA RTL Design
A complete **SystemVerilog implementation** of a UART Transmit Controller supporting configurable inter-byte delays, matrix-formatted multi-byte transmissions, and a fully integrated **seven-segment display subsystem**.  
Validated through testbenches and hardware implementation on the **Nexys A7-100T (Artix-7)** board.
